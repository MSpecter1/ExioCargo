# ExioCargo
Ship container management software that computes the optimal moves to perform transfer and balancing operations on a ship.

The folder ExioCargoApp has the combined files (including UI) to our code. The folders transfer and Balance contain just the algorithms/code for both the Transfer and Balance problems. These folders (i.e. transfer and Balance) contain the test cases for them as well.

The folder AppExioCargo contains the exe file for running our program. To run our program, run AppExioCargo.exe located in the AppExioCargo folder. The log file will be stored in the AppExioCargo folder when the program is running.

All Outbound Manifests will be stored on the user's desktop.
